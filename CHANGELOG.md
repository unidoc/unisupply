## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-08

First public release, production-ready for supply chain enforcement in CI/CD pipelines.

### New Features

#### Scanners

- **Vulnerability** — detects known CVEs across all direct and transitive
  dependencies using the Go vulnerability database (`vuln.go.dev`) with
  call-graph-aware reachability via `golang.org/x/vuln`.
- **Maintenance** — flags stale releases (>1 yr, >2 yr), archived repositories,
  and deprecated modules via the Go Module Proxy.
- **Maintainer** — evaluates GitHub contributor activity, bus factor, and
  organization verification status; uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` when present.
- **Typosquatting** — Levenshtein-distance comparison against ~75 well-known
  Go modules with confidence scoring.
- **Resilience** — scores release cadence, governance file presence
  (`LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODEOWNERS`), and
  version-scheme consistency on a 0–100 sub-scale.
- **AI-generated code** — flags modules matching supply-chain-attack patterns:
  very few releases, anonymous single maintainer, generic naming, no governance
  files.
- **CI/CD pipeline audit** — inspects `.github/workflows/*.yml` for unpinned
  action references, over-broad `permissions: write-all`, and secret-exposure
  patterns (`echo $SECRET`, `curl … $TOKEN`).
- **Build file** — detects unpinned Docker `FROM` images (`:latest`, no digest)
  and `curl | bash` / `wget | sh` patterns in `Dockerfile`, `Makefile`, and
  shell scripts.
- **Trust Index** — `--trust-index-url` enriches reports with curated trust
  scores and stewardship data from a
  [unitrust](https://github.com/unidoc/unitrust) instance.

#### Reporting & Policy

- **Weighted composite risk score** — 0–100 per dependency:
  `Vuln×0.40 + Maint×0.25 + Depth×0.15 + Maintainer×0.10 + Maturity×0.10`,
  with typosquat (+0–20) and AI-gen (+0–15) bonuses and a resilience credit
  (−0–6). Bands: LOW · MEDIUM · HIGH · CRITICAL.
- **Policy engine** — built-in `strict` and `moderate` presets plus custom
  JSON policies (`max_critical`, `max_high`, `max_vulnerability_age_days`,
  `require_pinned_actions`, `blocked_modules`, `whitelisted_modules`). Exits
  `2` on violation for CI fail-fast.
- **Output formats** — colored terminal text, JSON, enterprise PDF (UniPDF +
  UniChart), CycloneDX 1.5 SBOM, and SPDX 2.3 SBOM.
- **CLI** — `pflag`-based interface with per-scanner toggles, `--min-risk`
  filtering, `--policy` / `--policy-preset`, `--format`, `--output`,
  `--scan-ci`, `--scan-buildfiles`, and `--verbose`.

### Improvements

#### Release pipeline & security controls

- **Release pipeline** — SSH tag-signature verification against
  `.github/allowed_signers`, version-parity gate, 5-platform cross-compile
  (`linux`, `darwin`, `windows` × `amd64`/`arm64`), `SHA256SUMS`, dual SBOM
  generation, and draft GitHub Release creation on every signed tag push. (#3)
- **Trust anchor** — `.github/allowed_signers` populated with the real
  maintainer SSH signing key; `CODEOWNERS` narrowed to named maintainers so
  any trust-anchor change requires explicit approval. (#14)
- **Weekly security workflow** — `govulncheck`, `gosec`, `unisupply` self-scan
  (moderate preset), and 90-day staleness check; auto-files one GitHub issue
  per ISO week when any gate trips. (#6, #18)
- **SHA-pinned CI actions** — all `actions/*` references pinned to commit SHAs
  so the self-scan does not flag the project's own pipelines. (#6)

#### Code quality & developer experience

- **Centralized version constant** — single source of truth in
  `internal/version`; supports semver lifecycle suffixes (`-dev`, `-alpha.N`,
  `-beta.N`, `-rc.N`) and `ldflags`-injected `Commit` / `BuildDate` at build
  time. (#13)
- **Test coverage** — unit suites for all packages plus an integration suite
  exercising the full scan pipeline against embedded fixture data. (#1, #4, #13)
- **Deterministic SBOM output** — dependency ordering stabilized for
  reproducible builds. (#2)
- **`gosec` static analysis** — added to `golangci-lint`; production file-read
  callsites annotated with justified `#nosec G304`. (#6)
- **Documentation** — `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `RELEASING.md`, and `examples/` with annotated policy files and a ready-to-use
  CI workflow. (#11, #12, #15)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `security.yml` gosec step that required GitHub Advanced Security
  (unavailable on public repos); reworked to inline findings. (#8)
- Fixed `git` commands in `security.yml` that failed on the workflow runner. (#9)
- Fixed `verify-version-parity` action grep targets after the version constant
  was moved from `cmd/` and `pkg/report/text.go` to `internal/version`. (#16)

### Security Patches

- Upgraded `golang.org/x/vuln` `v1.1.4` → `v1.3.0` (direct dependency). (#17)
- Upgraded transitive `golang.org/x` dependencies to clear **12 CVEs** reported
  by `govulncheck`: `x/net` `v0.35.0` → `v0.53.0`, `x/crypto` `v0.33.0` →
  `v0.50.0`, `x/image` `v0.24.0` → `v0.39.0`. (#17)
- Self-scan risk score: 26/100 (MEDIUM) → 21/100 (LOW); CVE count: 12 → 0. (#17)
- CI/CD scanner refuses to follow symlinks outside the workflow directory,
  preventing path-traversal during scan.
- Policy engine always exits non-zero on violation — never fails silently.
- All GitHub API calls use `GITHUB_TOKEN` when present to prevent
  unauthenticated rate-limit abuse.
