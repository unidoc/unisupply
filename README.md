## What it does

`unisupply` analyzes a Go project's full module dependency chain and produces a
supply chain risk assessment. It runs nine focused scanners — vulnerability
lookup, maintenance health, maintainer analysis, typosquatting detection,
resilience scoring, AI-generated code heuristics, CI/CD pipeline audit, build
file inspection, and Trust Index lookup — combines the in-tree scanner signals
into a weighted risk score per dependency, attaches the optional Trust Index
data to each report alongside that score, and renders the result as a colored terminal
summary, machine-readable JSON, an enterprise PDF report, or a CycloneDX /
SPDX SBOM. A built-in policy engine fails CI on configurable thresholds
(critical vulns, max age, blocked modules, unpinned actions, ...).

It is intended for engineering teams that need to make merge-time and
release-time decisions about third-party Go code.

## Install

```bash
# Latest release (Go 1.25+ required)
go install github.com/unidoc/unisupply/cmd/unisupply@latest

# Pinned version (recommended for reproducible environments)
go install github.com/unidoc/unisupply/cmd/unisupply@v0.4.0

# Or download a prebuilt binary from the Releases page
#   https://github.com/unidoc/unisupply/releases
```

Homebrew and other package-manager distribution channels are tracked as
post-1.0 follow-ups; for now use `go install` or the release tarballs.

## Quick start

```bash
# Scan the current module
unisupply ./

# JSON output for CI ingestion
unisupply ./ --format json --output results.json

# Full PDF report (requires UNIDOC_LICENSE_API_KEY for PDF generation)
unisupply ./ \
    --format pdf \
    --output report.pdf \
    --github-token "$GITHUB_TOKEN"

# Policy-enforced run — exits 2 on violation
unisupply ./ --policy-preset strict
```

A typical text-format run against a small project looks like this (truncated
for the README — your output will list every direct and transitive
dependency):

## Scanners

| Scanner          | What it checks                                          | Data source                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Vulnerability    | Known CVEs in dependencies                              | Go vuln DB (vuln.go.dev)   |
| Maintenance      | Last release, archive status, deprecation               | Go Module Proxy            |
| Maintainer       | Contributors, bus factor, activity, org verification    | GitHub API                 |
| Typosquatting    | Levenshtein-similarity to ~75 well-known modules        | Built-in list              |
| Resilience       | Release cadence, governance files, version scheme       | GitHub API                 |
| AI-Generated     | Fresh modules, few releases, generic names (heuristics) | Module metadata            |
| CI/CD            | Action pinning, permissions, secret exposure            | `.github/workflows/*.yml`  |
| Build files      | Unpinned Docker images, `curl \| bash` patterns         | Dockerfile, Makefile, *.sh |
| Trust Index      | Curated trust scores                                    | unitrust API (optional)    |

The risk score is a weighted composite per dependency:

```
Per-Dep Risk Score (0–100) =
    Vulnerabilities × 0.40
  + Maintenance     × 0.25
  + Depth           × 0.15
  + Maintainer Risk × 0.10
  + Maturity        × 0.10
  + Typosquat Penalty      (0–20)
  + AI-Gen Penalty         (0–15)
  + Low-Resilience Penalty (0–6)  // adds when resilience score < 30
```

**Project headline score** is the maximum of four candidates — it never dilutes a single bad actor into a healthy-looking average:

```
Headline = max(severity_adjusted, p95_dep_risk, archived_floor, cve_floor)
```

| Candidate | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `severity_adjusted` | Step-function over reachability-downgraded CVE counts |
| `p95_dep_risk` | 95th-percentile of per-dep risk scores (nearest-rank) |
| `archived_floor` | HIGH floor (51) when any transitive dep is archived; 60 for a direct archived dep |
| `cve_floor` | Floor based on post-reachability CVE tier: called CRITICAL→60, called HIGH→55, imported CRITICAL/HIGH→40, required CRITICAL→40 |

**Example.** A project with 1 archived direct dep, 40 healthy deps, and one imported HIGH CVE:

| Candidate | Value |
| ------------------- | ----- |
| `severity_adjusted` | 10 |
| `p95_dep_risk` | 12 |
| `archived_floor` | 60 ← direct archived dep |
| `cve_floor` | 40 |

Result: **60 / HIGH — Driver: archived\_floor (direct archived dep)**

`MeanDepRiskScore` is still available as the top-level JSON field `mean_dep_risk_score` for trend lines, but is not the headline.

Levels: **LOW** 0–25 · **MEDIUM** 26–50 · **HIGH** 51–75 · **CRITICAL** 76–100.

## Output formats

| Format                | Flag                       | Use                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Text (colored)        | `--format text` (default)  | Interactive terminal use                            |
| JSON                  | `--format json`            | CI ingestion, dashboards, programmatic consumers    |
| PDF                   | `--format pdf`             | Enterprise reports (built with UniPDF + UniChart)   |
| CycloneDX SBOM        | `--format sbom-cyclonedx`  | Standard CycloneDX 1.5 software bill of materials   |
| SPDX SBOM             | `--format sbom-spdx`       | SPDX 2.3 software bill of materials                 |

The JSON output includes per-CVE reachability information. Each vulnerability
entry carries a `reachability` field (`"called"`, `"imported"`, or
`"required"`) that reflects how deeply the vulnerable symbol is reachable in
your build's call graph — see
[docs/scanners.md § Vulnerability reachability](docs/scanners.md#vulnerability-reachability)
for the exact definitions and scoring effect.

```json
{
  "module": "golang.org/x/net",
  "version": "v0.35.0",
  "risk_score": 72,
  "risk_level": "HIGH",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "id": "GO-2025-0001",
      "aliases": ["CVE-2025-12345"],
      "summary": "HTTP/2 request smuggling in golang.org/x/net/http2",
      "severity": "HIGH",
      "fixed_version": "v0.36.0",
      "reachability": "called"
    },
    {
      "id": "GO-2025-0002",
      "aliases": ["CVE-2025-67890"],
      "summary": "DoS in unused websocket handler",
      "severity": "MEDIUM",
      "fixed_version": "v0.36.0",
      "reachability": "imported"
    }
  ]
}
```

Absent `reachability` on a non-govulncheck finding is treated as `"called"`.

## Policy engine

`unisupply` ships two presets and accepts a custom JSON policy file. Policy
violations cause the binary to exit `2`, which is the convention CI systems
expect for a deliberate fail-fast.

```bash
# Built-in presets
unisupply ./ --policy-preset strict
unisupply ./ --policy-preset moderate

# Custom policy
unisupply ./ --policy ./security-policy.json
```

A minimal custom policy (every field is optional — see
[`pkg/policy/engine.go`](pkg/policy/engine.go) for the full set):

```json
{
  "max_overall_score": 50,
  "max_risk_score": 75,
  "no_critical_vulns": true,
  "no_archived": true,
  "no_deprecated": true,
  "no_typosquatting": true,
  "no_unmaintained_months": 24,
  "max_depth": 8,
  "max_ci_score": 50,
  "blocked_modules": ["github.com/suspicious/pkg"],
  "allowed_modules": ["golang.org/x/", "github.com/unidoc/"]
}
```

Notable fields:

- `no_known_vulns` / `no_critical_vulns` — fail on any vuln, or only on
  high/critical-severity vulns.
- `no_single_maintainer` — fail if any **direct** dependency has bus factor ≤ 1.
- `allowed_modules` — when set, acts as a strict whitelist applied to **direct
  dependencies only**; transitive modules are not gated by this rule. Each
  entry matches by exact module path or by path-prefix (`"golang.org/x/"`
  matches `golang.org/x/net`); glob patterns are not supported.
- `blocked_modules` — applies to direct and transitive dependencies, with the
  same exact-or-prefix matching rule.
- `max_ci_score` — gate on the CI/CD scanner's overall risk score (requires
  `--scan-ci`).

<!-- TODO (PR 08 / M6.5): once the examples/ directory lands, link to ready-to-copy policy files here. -->

## Trust Index integration

`unisupply` can enrich a scan with curated trust data from a running
[unitrust](https://github.com/unidoc/unitrust) instance. The Trust Index is
UniDoc's curated database of Go module trustworthiness — it goes beyond what
public APIs and heuristics can tell you (vulnerability feeds, GitHub
contributor counts, release cadence) and adds **vetted, human-reviewed**
metadata: who actually maintains the package, what country and organization
they operate from, whether their identity is verified, the package's
stewardship status, and — when a module is known-risky — a recommended safer
alternative.

### How it works

When `--trust-index-url` points at a reachable unitrust instance, every
discovered module (direct and transitive) is sent in a **single batched
HTTP request** to `POST /api/v1/lookup`. The returned data is folded into
each dependency's report alongside the in-tree scanner output. No per-module
calls, no fan-out — one round trip regardless of graph size.

```bash
# Hosted unitrust (production CI)
unisupply ./ \
    --trust-index-url https://unitrust.unidoc.io \
    --format json --output results.json
```

### What the Trust Index adds to a report

For every module that unitrust has data on, the report gains:

| Field                     | What it tells you                                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `trust_score`             | Composite curated trust score (0–100)                                |
| `maintainer_trust`        | Curated confidence in the maintainer's identity and track record     |
| `resilience_score`        | Project resilience as assessed by UniDoc, not just heuristics        |
| `security_score`          | Curated security posture (review history, hardening, response time)  |
| `community_score`         | Community health beyond raw star/fork counts                         |
| `maintainer_name`         | Real maintainer name where known                                     |
| `maintainer_org`          | Sponsoring or employing organization                                 |
| `maintainer_country`      | Maintainer jurisdiction — relevant for compliance / sanctions checks |
| `maintainer_verified`     | Whether UniDoc has verified the maintainer's identity                |
| `stewardship_status`      | `actively_maintained`, `community`, `inactive`, `abandoned`, …       |
| `safer_alternative`       | Recommended replacement module, if the entry is flagged as risky     |
| `is_unidoc_maintained`    | True for modules under UniDoc's own stewardship                      |

The full schema lives in
[`pkg/scanner/trustindex.go`](pkg/scanner/trustindex.go) (`TrustIndexEntry`).
Modules unitrust has no entry for are reported with their normal scanner
output unchanged.

### When to use it

- **CI gating** — combine `--trust-index-url` with `--policy-preset strict`
  to fail builds on known-risky modules whose risk isn't yet visible in the
  CVE feeds.
- **Procurement / vendor review** — the maintainer name, country, and
  verification flag are the fields enterprise reviewers actually need; they
  are not derivable from `go.mod` alone.
- **Supply-chain incident response** — the `safer_alternative` field
  short-circuits "what should we replace this with?" during a live
  incident.

### Privacy and operational notes

- The lookup payload contains **only module paths** — the same information
  that is already in your published `go.mod`. Versions are not transmitted,
  and the request includes no source code, scan results, or other
  project-identifying data.
- The whole feature is **opt-in and additive**. Leaving `--trust-index-url`
  off produces a fully self-contained scan — `unisupply` never reaches out
  to unitrust by default and has no implicit endpoint.
- Failures of the Trust Index call (network errors, non-200 responses) are
  surfaced as warnings; they do not abort the scan or alter risk scores
  derived from the in-tree scanners.
- **SSRF defense.** `--trust-index-url` requires `https` for all non-loopback
  hosts. RFC1918, link-local (`169.254/16`), and IPv6 ULA/link-local addresses
  are rejected unless `--trust-index-allow-private` is set. Use
  `--trust-index-allow-private` only when running a self-hosted unitrust on a
  private network — never in public CI where the flag value could be
  controlled by an attacker. A warning is printed before each POST so the
  destination is always visible in logs.
